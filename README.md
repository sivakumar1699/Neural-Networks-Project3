This repository contains solutions to five NLP and deep learning tasks, implemented using Python, TensorFlow, NLTK, spaCy, and HuggingFace Transformers. 
Each task includes both code and explanatory answers.

Q1: Text Generation with RNN (LSTM)
1)Implemented a character-level LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
2)Trained on a subset of *The Little Prince* dataset.
3)Demonstrated text generation using temperature scaling.

Q2: NLP Preprocessing Pipeline**
1)Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming using NLTK.
2)Processed the sentence:  
2.a)NLP techniques are used in virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri.
Output: Token list, tokens without stopwords, and stemmed words.

Q3: Named Entity Recognition with spaCy
1)Used spaCyâ€™s `en_core_web_sm` model for NER.
2)Extracted named entities, their labels, and character positions from a given sentence.

Q4: Scaled Dot-Product Attention
1)Implemented scaled dot-product attention from scratch using NumPy.
2)Outputs include attention weights and the final result matrix.

Q5: Sentiment Analysis with HuggingFace Transformers
1)Used `pipeline()` from the `transformers` library to perform sentiment analysis.
2)Analyzed the sentence:  
2.a)Despite the high price, the performance of the new MacBook is outstanding.
Output: Sentiment label and confidence score.
