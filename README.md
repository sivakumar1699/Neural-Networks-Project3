Deep Learning & NLP Tasks with TensorFlow, spaCy, and HuggingFace

This repository contains solutions to five deep learning and NLP tasks implemented in Python using TensorFlow, NLTK, spaCy, and HuggingFace Transformers. It includes a character-level LSTM model trained on The Little Prince dataset for text generation with temperature scaling, a preprocessing pipeline that demonstrates tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming, and a named entity recognition task using spaCyâ€™s pretrained model to extract entities with their labels and positions. The project also features an implementation of scaled dot-product attention from scratch in NumPy, showcasing how attention weights and result matrices are computed, and a sentiment analysis pipeline leveraging HuggingFace Transformers to evaluate text with confidence scores. Together, these tasks highlight practical applications of deep learning in text generation, preprocessing, attention mechanisms, entity recognition, and sentiment classification
